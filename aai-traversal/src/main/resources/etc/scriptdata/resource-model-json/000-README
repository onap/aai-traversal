Add resource models here in the order you want them to be added to the graph.

Recommended that they are spaced by 10's.

So, if you are adding a resource model it should be:

100-ipe-resource-model-1.0.json
110-vBgf-resource-model-1.0.json

This will allow others to insert models between existing models.
